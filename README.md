# Chudnofsky
This is C# code based on the Python code found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chudnovsky_algorithm). I'm also using `BigRational`, which can be found [here](https://github.com/MicrosoftArchive/bcl/blob/master/Libraries/BigRational/BigRationalLibrary/BigRational.cs). This was just a fun exercise that I did one night, and it appears to get the right value of pi, though it takes a bit of time to get there.
